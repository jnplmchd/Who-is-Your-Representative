# Who-is-Your-Representative
This was a web application project done for CSC-360 Web Development and Scraping at Eastern Connecticut State University.

The goal of this project was to create a webpage in which inputting an address will output a table describing the representatives of that given address from local government and federal government.

This was accomplished using the Google Civic Information API and uses simple HTML and CSS and Javascript to create the table of officials at the given address.

Things which I would like to include are the addition of a "find me" button using the Google Maps API.
